Module 1 README: Security 101

Module Description
Welcome! This document is a weekly module README. It provides an overview of the module, along with technical lab information, useful resources, and links to Challenge homework assignments. Students will see a version of this document in Canvas for each module.

In this module, we will become familiar with the structure of the course and learn about some of the tools and topics that this course will cover. We will cover fundamental cybersecurity concepts, like the CIA triad, and work in groups to assess attack and defense strategies of vulnerable data.

On the final day of this module, we will focus on professional pathways by studying cybersecurity certifications, domains, and professions.

Module Objectives

Day 1: The Cybersecurity Mindset

Explain the course structure and general direction of the program.

Recognize the high-level security strategies and tools that we will cover in class.

Define cybersecurity as the assessment of threats and the mitigation of risk.

Define the CIA triad and its elements.

Day 2: Attacking and Defending

List different types of user, web, server, and database cybersecurity attacks.

Identify risk mitigation plan frameworks for user, web, server, and database cybersecurity attacks.

Day 3: Surveying the Cyberspace

Consider roles and career pathways within the cybersecurity space.

Examine the landscape of certifications available to security professionals.

Explore what the Security+ exam is and which InfoSec pathways benefit from the certification.

What to Be Aware Of

Throughout the course, we will use features on Zoom and Slack to optimize the online learning experience. These tools include breakout rooms for group activities and class polls to assess comprehension after activities.

On Day 3, we will cover cybersecurity professional pathways and certifications. It is perfectly okay if students do not have a strong sense of the specific pathways they would like to pursue at this time. Over the next 24 weeks, this boot camp will present a wide scope of cybersecurity skills and domains, giving them the opportunity to narrow down what interests and motivates them.

Security+ Domains
On Day 3 of this module, we will introduce the Security+ exam and its domains. In the coming modules, we will provide details about other domains covered on the exam.
For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

Module 1: Challenge Assignment
This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.

For this moduleâ€™s Challenge, students will review three real-world cybersecurity reports and answer questions about each.

Looking Forward
The next module will cover governance, risk, and complianceâ€”three fundamental concepts security teams use to instill strong security controls and a healthy security culture within organizations.
We will examine how a security team interacts with the larger business organization, and identify and prioritize attacks and vulnerabilities through risk management and threat modeling frameworks. We will also learn about various regulations and laws that inform the policies that security teams enforce.
