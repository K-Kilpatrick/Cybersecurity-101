Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report
In this part, use the Verizon Data Breaches Investigation Report plus independent research to answer the following questions.
______________________________________________________________________
1.	What is the difference between an incident and a breach? 

An incident: A security event that compromises the integrity, confidentiality or availability of an information asset. A breach: an incident that results in the confirmed disclosure-not just potential exposure-of data to an unauthorized party. (Found this on Page 4 of Verizon Data Breach Report)

4.	In 2020, what percent of breaches were financially motivated? 

Nearly 100% of breaches were financially motivated in 2020.(Found this on Page 12 of Verizon Data Breach Report)
5.	Define the following (additional research may be required outside of the report): 

Denial of service:The Denial of Service pattern consists 
of attacks intended to compromise the availability of networks and systems. 
This pattern includes both network and application layer attacks, and is the most common pattern across incidents. (Found this on Page 35 of Verizon Data Breach Report)

Command control:A command-and-control (C2) server is a main tool cyber threat actors have in their arsenal to launch and control cyber attacks. Threat actors use C2s to send commands to their malware and to distribute malicious programs, malicious scripts, and more. They also use them to receive stolen data that they exfiltrated from target servers, devices, websites, and forms. In short, C2s are the technical brain behind a threat actor’s malicious operations. (Found this on an external site: https://www.feroot.com/education-center/what-is-a-command-and-control-c2-server/#:~:text=A%20command%2Dand%2Dcontrol%20(C2)%20server%20is%20a,%2C%20malicious%20scripts%2C%20and%20more.)

Backdoor:A backdoor attack is a way to access a computer system or encrypted data that bypasses the system's customary security mechanisms. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application, operating system (OS) or data can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes. Attackers make use of backdoors that software developers install, and they also install backdoors themselves as part of a computer exploit.(Found this on an external site: https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/back-door)

Keylogger:A keylogger or keystroke logger/keyboard capturing is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server. The hacker then analyzes the keystrokes to locate usernames and passwords and uses them to hack into otherwise secure systems.(Found this on an external site: https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-keyloggers)
6.	What remains one of the most sought-after data types for hackers? 

As we have pointed out in previous reports, Credentials remain one of the most sought-after data types (Found this on Page 22 of Verizon Data Breach Report)



7.	What was the percentage of breaches that involved phishing?

Phishing continues to walk hand-inhand with Use of stolen credentials 
in breaches as it has in the past.Admittedly, we expected to see an increase here due to a larger remote workforce. However, the numbers have remained in the region of 25% of breaches, which is still a significant number. (Found this on Page 16 of Verizon Data Breach Report)
