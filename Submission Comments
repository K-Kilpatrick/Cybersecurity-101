Hello Kelly,



Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! Your demonstration of your knowledge of recent cybersecurity statistics is truly impressive.



You've excelled in answering all the questions on the Crowdstrike document, providing clear and well-articulated responses. However, there was a missed opportunity on the following question:

-What are the three parts of the eCrime ecosystem that CrowdStrike highlighted in their report?



In Part 2: Akamai, you've performed exceptionally well, and your efforts are commendable.



Now, in Part 3: Verizon Data Breaches Investigation, you've done a great job overall, but there were a couple of questions where points were missed:

-In 2020, what percent of breaches were financially motivated?

-What was the percentage of breaches involving phishing??



Your submission reflects your commitment to producing high-quality work, Kelly, and we encourage you to maintain this level of excellence as the class continues. Keep up the good work!



Best Regards,

Josh
